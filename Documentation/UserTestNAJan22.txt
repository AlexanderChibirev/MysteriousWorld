User Tester Name: Natalia A. 

Date: January 22, 2017

1) What do you see in front of you?
Answer: a panel and the word "start". 

2) What do you think of the directions on the panel?
Answer: the direction are clear.

3) What does pressing a button do?
Answer: it switches the panels.  

* Note to self: while the tester didn't mention anything about this, I found that when the buttons switched color (because they were hit by a ray), it was more distracting than helpful.
