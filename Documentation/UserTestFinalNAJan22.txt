User Tester Name: Natalia A. 

Date: January 22, 2017

First Round:

-- the user did not understand what to do with the orbs and she could not hear the "failure" sound because the ambient music was too loud

-- she thought that the purple particles flying from the orbs were distracting

Fixes:

1) I changed the instructions on the welcome screen to tell the user what to do.
2) I removed the particles from the orbs.
3) I made the ambient music softer and the "failure" sound louder.

Second Round:

-- the sound was better but the user kept clicking the Cardboard button while looking at an orb, which resulted
in a double-click

Fixes:

1) I added a third line of instructions telling users to AVOID clicking the button.
