Name: Josh

Age: 26

Occupation: Network Admin

Quote: "My job is not my life."

Motivation: Josh likes his networking job at Blue Cross Blue Shield on most days but lately
it's been pretty stressful and he's thinking about moving to a smaller company. Josh's big immediate
goal is to train for and enter the Boston marathon. 

He always has his iPhone in his pocket and a laptop at home but does not own a gaming console and is at best a casual gamer. He's curious about VR but he's not interested in spending money on high-end hardware.
